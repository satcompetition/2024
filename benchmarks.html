	<h2>Benchmarks</h2>

	<h4>Benchmark Submission</h4>
	<p>
	We would like to invite and encourage submissions of benchmarks and benchmark generators for all the tracks of the competition.
	</p>
	<p>
	Each Main Track participant (team) is required to submit 20 new benchmark instances (not seen in previous competitions). 
	At least 10 of those benchmarks should be "interesting": not too easy (solvable by MiniSat in a minute) or 
	too hard (unsolvable by the participants own solver within one hour on a computer similar to the nodes of the 
	<a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/machine-specs.txt">StarExec cluster</a>).
	</p>
	<p>
	Participants should submit benchmarks by emailing them to "organizers@satcompetition.org" with the 
	subject "SAT Competition Benchmark Submission" and either a URL link or attachment of a single archive containing the benchmarks.
	</p>

	<h4>Input and Output Format</h4>
	<p>
	Benchmarks have to be formatted according to the
	<a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2011/format-benchmarks2011.html">SAT Competition 2011 Benchmark Submission Guidelines</a>.
	A 1-2 page benchmark description document, using the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE Proceedings style</a>,
	must be submitted with each submitted benchmark family, following the instructions for solver descriptions.
	The benchmark descriptions will be made available similarly as the solver descriptions (see <a href="rules.html">general rules</a>).
	</p>

	<h4>Benchmark Selection</h4>
	<p>
	The benchmark problems will be selected randomly from the set of benchmarks submitted by the participants and by the organizers.
