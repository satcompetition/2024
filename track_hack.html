	<h2>CaDiCaL Hack Track</h2>

	<p>
	Hack Tracks have been part of many SAT Competition since 2009.
	The motivation of hack tracks is two-fold. 
	On the one hand, we want to lower the threshold for Master and PhD students to enter the SAT Competition with new and innovative ideas. 
	On the other hand, the aim is to see how far the performance of CaDiCaL can be improved by making only minor changes to its source code. 
	Competing with minor hacks helps the community to isolate the actual causes of improvements. 
	Thus, we strongly encourage all participants of the Main track (including non-students) to participate with a "hacked" CaDiCaL solver.
	
	</p>

	<p>
	Participants in the CaDiCaL Hack Track should use the source of the newly released <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical/tree/rel-1.4.0">CaDiCaL 1.4</a>. 
	These sources include a comfortable <a href="https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical/blob/rel-1.4.0/scripts/prepare-sc2021-submission.sh">script for preparing the submission for StarExec</a>. 
	In order to qualify as a CaDiCaL Hack, the diff between the patched and modified sources of CaDiCaL 1.4 has to be less than 1000 non-space characters.
	You can use our <a href="downloads/editdistance.zip">edit distance tool</a> on all modified files to count the number of modifications.
