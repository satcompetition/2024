	<h2>Cloud Track</h2>

The Cloud Track will evaluate the effectiveness of parallel SAT solvers to run in a distributed manner. 
This track will be run on Amazon Web Services.
The solvers participating in this track will be executed with a wall-clock time limit of 1000 seconds running 
on 100 m4.4xlarge machines in parallel. Each m4.4xlarge machine has 16 virtual CPUs and 64 GB memory. 
Communication between the machines is possible using MPI and SSH. 
<BR><BR>

Similar to the Parallel Track, participants of this track are required to submit their solver 
via a GitHub repository (which can be private). The repository should contain a docker file
that compiles the solver. Scripts for account configuration and instructions to run HordeSAT
in the default configuration are available at: 
<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-comp-infrastructure-sample">https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-comp-infrastructure-sample</a>.
We also provide an exmaple repository using the HordeSAT solver:
<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-hordesat-sample">https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-hordesat-sample</a>.

<h4>Solver Submission</h4>
