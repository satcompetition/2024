	<h2>Certified UNSAT</h2>
	All participants in the Main track of this competition are required to output certificates of unsatisfiablity. 
	Certificates of unsatisfiability have been required for the UNSAT tracks since SAT Competition 2013. 
	As of SAT Competition 2023, participants can select from several proof systems and formats. 
	<br>
	The following proof checkers are provided and described in the respective documents.

	<!-- Although resolution proof formats have been supported in the past, 
	this SAT Competition will only support clausal proofs. The main reason 
	for this restriction is that no participant in recent years showed any 
	interest in providing resolution as such proofs as too complicated to 
	produce and they cost too much space to store.<br>

	The proof format of this SAT Competition is the same as in 2014, i.e., 
	<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/" target="_blank">DRAT</a> 
	(Delete Resolution Asymmetric Tautologies) which is backwards compatible 
	with both RUP (Reverse Unit Propagation) and 
	<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drup/" target="_blank">DRUP</a>.
	During SAT Competition 2014, a few runs produced proofs of over 100GB, the local storage limit. 
	Thus, we will also support a <b>binary DRAT format</b>. Details and the checker will be made 
	available on the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/">DRAT website</a>.
	</p>

	<p>

	<b>The proof should be written into a (text/binary) file called "proof.out", which is then passed to the verifier.</b> <br> 
	The output of the solver though should conform to the following rules:
	<ul>
	<li> Comment lines are to be prepended by <b>&quot;c &quot;</b></li>
	<li> In case of UNSAT a proof in the DRAT format should be written into "proof.out"</li>
	<li> Solution line <b>&quot;s SATISFIABLE&quot;</b> or <b>&quot;s UNSATISFIABLE&quot;</b></li>
	</ul>
	The solution line can appear anywhere in the output of the solver, though 
	the solution &quot;v ...&quot; in case of SAT should appear after the solution line 
	&quot;s SATISFIABLE&quot; as it is the case in the original specification<br>

	<h3>Format</h3>

	Below, a brief description of the proof format based on an example formula. 
	The new proof format DRAT is backwards compatible with both the DRUP and RUP formats.
	More details about DRUP can be found <a href="http://cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drup/" target="_blank">here</a>.

	The spacing in the examples is to improve readability. Consider the following
	formula in the DIMACS format.
	<br><br>
	<pre>
	p cnf 4 8
	 1  2 -3 0
	-1 -2  3 0
	 2  3 -4 0
	-2 -3  4 0
	 1  3  4 0
	-1 -3 -4 0
	-1  2  4 0
	 1 -2 -4 0
	</pre>
	<br>




	A proof of the above formula in the RUP (and thus DRAT) format is:
	<br><br>
	<pre>
	1 2 0
	1 0
	2 0
	0
	</pre>
	<br>
	RUP proofs are a sequence of clauses that are redundant with respect to the input formula. 
	The check that a clause C is redundant, all literals l in C are assigned to false followed
	by unit propagation. In order to verify redundancy, unit propagation should result in 
	a conflict. The redundant clause is added to the formula in case the check is successful.
	The conflict clauses clauses produced by conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL) solvers
	have the RUP property. Therefore, a sequence of all conflict clauses (in the order of 
	learning) is a RUP proof for unsatisfiable formulas. 

	<br><br>
	One important disadvantage of checking RUP proofs is the cost to verify a proof. 
	The DRUP format (Delete Reverse Unit 
	Propagation) was developed to counter this disadvantage. 
	The DRUP format extends the RUP format by allowing it to express 
	clause elimination information within the proof format.
	<br><br>
	<pre>
	   1  2  0
	d  1  2 -3 0
	   1  0
	d  1  2  0
	d  1  3  4 0
	d  1 -2 -4 0
	   2  0
	   0
	</pre>
	<br>
	Apart from the redundant RUP clauses, a DRUP proof may contain lines with a &#39;d&#39;
	prefix. These lines refer to clauses (original or learned) that can be deleted
	without influencing the proof checking. In the above example, all the deleted 
	clauses are subsumed by added RUP clauses. In practice, however, the clauses 
	that one wants to include in a DRUP proof are the clauses that are removed 
	while reducing the (learned) clause database.<br><br>


	Some state-of-the-art SAT solvers use techniques, such as extended resolution,
	that cannot be validated using RUP.
	The DRAT format (Delete Resolution Asymmetric Tautologies) was developed to 
	deal with this.
	<br><br>
	<pre>
	   1  0
	d  1  2 -3 0
	d  1  2  0
	d  1  3  4 0
	d  1 -2 -4 0
	   2  0
	   0
	</pre>
	<br>
	The syntax of DRAT proofs is identical to DRUP proofs. Lines contain either
	a &#39;d&#39; expression deletion, or have no prefix expression clause addition.

	<h3>Binary Format</h3>

	<h5>Mapping DIMACS Literals to Unsigned Integers</h5>

	The first step of the binary encoding is mapping literals in 
	the DIMACS format to unsigned integers. The following mapping function is used:
	map(l) := (l > 0)? 2*l : -2*l + 1. The mapping for some DIMACS literals are shown below.<BR><BR>

	<pre>     DIMACS literals   unsigned integers
						  
					 -63     127
					 129     258   
				   -8191   16383
				   -8193   16387
	</pre><BR>

	<h5>Variable-Byte Encoding of Unsigned Integers</h5>
	  
	  Assume that 'w0, ..., wi' are 7-bit words, 'w1' to 'wi' all non zero and
	  the unsigned number 'x' can be represented as<BR><BR>
		
	<pre>    x = w0 + 2^7*w1 + 2^14*w2 + 2^(7*i)*wi</pre><BR>

	  The variable-byte encoding of DRAT (also used in <A href="http://fmv.jku.at/aiger/">AIGER</A>) is the sequence of 
	  i bytes b0, ... bi:<BR><BR>

	<pre>    1w0, 1w1, 1w2, ..., 0wi </pre><BR>

	  The MSB of a byte in this sequence signals whether this byte is the last
	  byte in the sequence, or whether there are still more bytes to follow.
	  Here are some examples:<BR><BR>

	<pre>    unsigned integer   byte sequence of encoding (in hexadecimal)
	 
					   x   b0 b1 b2 b3 b4
						  
					   0   00
					   1   01
		2^7-1    =   127   7f
		2^7      =   128   80 01
		2^8  + 2 =   258   82 02
		2^14 - 1 = 16383   ff 7f
		2^14 + 3 = 16387   83 80 01
		2^28 - 1           ff ff ff 7f
		2^28 + 7           87 80 80 80 01
	</pre><br>

	<h5>Bringing it together</h5>

	In the binary DRAT format, each clause consists of at least two bytes. The
	first byte expresses whether the lemma is added (character 'a' or 61 in 
	hexadecimal) or deleted (character 'd' or 64 in hexadecimal). The last byte
	of each lemma is the zero byte (00 in hexadecimal). In between these two 
	bytes, the literals of the lemma are shown as unsigned integers in the 
	variable-byte encoding.<BR><BR>

	In the example below, the plain DRAT format requires 26 bytes (including the 
	new line characters and excluding the redundant spaces in the second lemma), 
	while the binary DRAT format of the same proof requires only 12 bytes. Emiting
	proofs in the binary format reduces the size on disk by approximatedly a 
	factor of three compared to the conventional (plain) DRAT format.<BR><BR>
