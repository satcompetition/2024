	<h2>Parallel and Cloud Track Submissions</h2>

<p>
Please make sure to adhere to the <a href="rules.html">General Rules</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Parallel and Cloud tracks will be run on Amazon Web Services. 
Participants of these tracks are required to submit their solver via
a GitHub repository. The instructions for submissions are available here:
<a href="https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-comp-infrastructure-sample">
  https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-batch-comp-infrastructure-sample</a>.
</p>
<p>
The AWS team worked hard to improve the developer experience for participants of the parallel and cloud tracks. As compared with the 2022 infrastructure, the following has been added or modified:<br />
1. Scripts and instructions for local debugging of both parallel and distributed solvers on your workstation/laptop.<br />
2. Automated upload of stdout/stderr and intermediate files for each run to S3 storage so that you can debug runs after completion.<br />
3. A "quickstart" that allows you to build the infrastructure and solver, then run it using only two commands.<br />
4. Default values for most of the required arguments from 2022 to make it much simpler to run commands.<br />
5. A richer input.json format that is used for solver communication that allows passing arguments to solvers, 
a timeout, and information about the input format.<br />
6. A change in the expected solver output format in solver_out.json. This year, the satisfiability/unsatisfiability
of the problem is indicated by the return code of the solver (10 for SAT, 20 for UNSAT)<br />
7. Various improvements and bug fixes in the scripts for building/running jobs to provide better observability 
of the process.
